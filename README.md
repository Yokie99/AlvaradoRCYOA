Peer Review: Kyle Yok Eyh Ma
The CYOA works nicely. The images and buttons are consistent throughout all the pages. I enjoyed that each image was hand drawn. The code is clean too. Only comment I have is that there are some unnecessary <div>'s and commented out portions of the code that should be deleted instead if it is not going to be used. Also the pages are all named with lower case letters but for whatever reason "Three" is capitalized.
